## Design

### Architecture

Now let us explore the architecture of Uncle Jim's Discount To-do App to help you understand how it works.

<img src="diagrams/Architecture Diagram.png" />

<figcaption>Simplistic overview of the application</figcaption>

The architecture diagram above explains the high-level design of the application. Here is a quick overview of each component:

* `Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/todo/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:

    * Bootstrapping the application at app launch by initializing the components in the correct sequence and injecting the dependencies needed for each component.
    * Shutting down the components and invoke cleanup method where necessary during shut down.

* [**`Commons`**](#common-modules) represents a collection of modules used by multiple other components 
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The user facing elements of tha App, representing the view layer 
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The parser and command executer, representing the controller 
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Data manipulation and storage, representing the model and data layer

### Model component

<img src="diagrams/Model Component.png" />

<figcaption>The relation between the Model subcomponents</figcaption>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/todo/model/Model.java)

The model component represents the application's state and data layer. It is implemented by `TodoModel`, which is a composite of of the individual data models for the application, as well as higher level information about the state of the application itself, such as the current view and the undo/redo stack. Model has two subcomponents:

- `TodoList` - represents the todolist tasks
- `UserPrefs` - represents saved user preferences 

Each individual data model handles their own CRUD operations, with the `Model` acting as a simplified and uniform interface for external components to work with. Each of the data model holds an injectable `Storage` object that exposes a simple interface for reading and writing to the appropriate storage mechanism. 

To avoid tight coupling with the command classes, the model exposes only a small set of generic functions. The UI component binds to the model through a set of getters, such as `getObservableList`, which expose JavaFX [`Property`][property] objects that the UI can listen to for changes. 

The model ensure safety by exposing as much of its internal state as possible as immutable objects using interfaces such as `ImmutableTask`.

<img src="diagrams/Storage Component.png" />

<figcaption>The relation between the Storage subcomponents</figcaption>

The storage component represents the persistence layer of the data. It is implemented by `TodoListStorage` which holds and contains `ImmutableTodoList`. Similarly, `JsonUserPrefsStorage` stores the user preferences. 

Both classes implement `FixedStorage`, which exposes methods to read and save data from storage. Users can choose to move their storage file, hence `MovableStorage` is exposed to allow them to do so. User preferences cannot be exported.

### Model

See the [Model component architecture](#model-component) section for the high level overview of the Model and Storage components.

#### BaseTask

The `BaseTask` is a simple abstract class to identify each task uniquely via Java's `UUID` class. Do note that this implementation means that two tasks with exact same content (fields) can be considered as two different tasks.

#### ImmutableTask

This interface is used frequently to expose fields of a `Task` to external components. It prevents external components from having access to the setters.

#### Task

A `Task` is a representation of a task or event in the todolist. `Task` inherits from `BaseTask` for a way to declare each task as unique. This object implements `MutableTask` which allows us to edit the fields.

#### ValidationTask

A `ValidationTask` is a representation of a task or event in the todolist. This class allows us to verify the fields of the task, and check that they are valid, as the name implies. This class is used mainly for adding and updating a task, as `Task` is supposed to be immutable.


#### TodoList

This class represents the todolist inside the memory and implements the `TodoListModel`. This interface is internal to Model and represents only CRUD operations to the todolist.

#### TodoModel

This class represents the data layer of the application and implements the `Model` interface. The `TodoModel` handles any interaction with the application state that is not persisted, such as the view (sort and filtering), undo and redo commands.

#### ErrorBag

The `ErrorBag` is a wrapper around errors produced while handling a command. To use the `ErrorBag`, simply create a new instance of it and `put` errors into it. At the end of the validation routine, call `validate` to let the bag throw a `ValidationException` if there are any. 

#### FixedStorage

This interface represents the persistence mechanism for a file whose location is cannot be set by the user. You can use this interface for storing preferences and other files which the user does not need to change the location for. 

#### MovableStorage 

This interface enables us to declare a storage mechanism as movable. This means that the file path of the object can be changed when desired. The only class that implements this interface is `TodoListStorage`, as the configuration and user preference files have minimal impact and thus unimportant for the user.

#### TodoListStorage

The main class that is exposed to the Model. In addition to reading and saving, methods are exposed to enable user to switch where the storage file is saved and read.

#### Xml Classes

Classes prefixed with `Xml` are classes used to enable serialization of the Model. As the prefix suggests, the critical data is stored in the `.xml` file format and uses `JAXB` to read and save to the persistence layer. `JAXB` marshals Java primitives readily, however, if you wish to marshal any other classes, be it self-implemented or from a library, you would need to declare a `XmlAdapter`. See `LocalDateTimeAdapter` for reference.

### Marking a task complete: **`complete`**

Format:  
**`complete`**` INDEX`  
**`complete`**` /all`

After finishing a task, you can mark it complete by specifying the index of the task you wish to mark complete in the `INDEX` parameter. Completed tasks have their title struckthrough. 

If you wish to mark a batch of task in the current view as complete, you can use the `/all` flag to mark them all as complete. 

<img src="images/app_completed.png" width="700" alt="Example of a Completed Task" />

<figcaption>The satisfying view of a completed task</figcaption>

Note that this is a toggle command, so if the specified task is already completed, running this will mark the task as incomplete again. 


### Clearing tasks: **`clear`**

Format:  
**`clear`**

If you start to have a lot of completed tasks building up, you can clear the clutter by deleting all of them with  `clear`. Note that this only clears completed tasks in the current view. 

### Pinning a task: **`pin`**

Format: **`pin`**` INDEX`

If a particular task or event is important, you can pin it to the top of every list the item appears in using this command. You can also use this command to unpin any pinned task. 

<img src="images/app_pin.png" width="540" alt="Pinned Task">

<figcaption>Prioritize important tasks with pinned tasks.</figcaption>

### Editing a task: **`edit`**

Format:  
**`edit`**` INDEX [NAME] [/d DEADLINE] [/m DESCRIPTION] [/r TIME] [/p]`  
**`edit`**` INDEX [NAME] [/d START END] [/m DESCRIPTION] [/l LOCATION] [/p]`

You can edit tasks or events using the `edit` command. This command accepts the same parameters as the `add` command with the addition of `INDEX`, which specifies which task or event you want to edit. 

Note that edits are automatically saved, and any errors can be undone using `undo`. 

```
