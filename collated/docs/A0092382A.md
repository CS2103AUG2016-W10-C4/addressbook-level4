### Common modules

Modules used by multiple components are in the `seedu.todo.commons` package.

#### Core

The core module contains many important classes used throughout the application.

* `UnmodifiableObservableList`:  Used by the UI component to listen to changes to the data through the Observer pattern.
* `Events`: Used by components to marshal information around and inform other components that things have happened. (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter`: Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

#### Util

The util module contains many different helper methods and classes used throughout the application. The things that can, and should be reused can be found in here.

* `TimeUtil`: Used by Ui to display time that is readable and user friendly.
* `XmlUtil`: Used by storage to save and read .xml files.

#### Exceptions

The exceptions module contains all common exceptions that will be used and thrown throughout the application.

* `IllegalValueException`: Used by Logic and Model internally to signal that a single value is invalid
* `ValidationException` : Used by Logic and Model classes to signal that the command or model parsed is invalid.

### Entering in dates 

Uncle Jim supports flexible date formats so you can enter dates in the formats specified below:

* **Formal dates**

    Dates in a standard numerical form such as DDMMYYYY or DD/MM/YY. 
  
    !!! example 
        1978-01-28  
        29/10/94

* **Relaxed dates**

   It is not always necessary to write it in full formal date formats - Uncle Jim allows relaxed date formats as well. If you don't include the full date, we will use the current month or year 
  
    !!! example 
        Oct 12 9pm
        9 May
  

* **Relative dates**

    We also understand days of the week and even relative date and time. 

    !!! example
        next Thursday  
        tomorrow evening  
        in two days

!!! note If no time is specified when entering a date, Uncle Jim will use the current time by default 


### Viewing help: **`help`**

Format: **`help`**

Help allows you to have a quick reference of the commands in case you forgot the format to follow.

## Other Features

### Visual Feedback

Our user interface is very interactive and features a lot of visual feedback to the user. For example, for commands such as add, edit and show, you can see upon which task your action acts upon by viewing which task is highlighted.

Also, Uncle Jim distinguishes between tasks and events, not only by different tag colors but by also handling them differently. For example, if you have a task that is overdue, Uncle Jim will instantly highlight it <strong class="text-red">red</strong>. 

For events which are ongoing, they will be highlighted <strong class="text-green">green</strong>.

For events which have passed, they will be <strong class="text-faded">faded</strong>, but we leave it to you to mark the events complete.

### Intelligent Command™

As you get more advanced with Uncle Jim, you might find typing the full command slightly cumbersome. To speed up your workflow you can type our just the first few characters of a command, because our Intelligent Command™ system can recognise commands even if you do not type them out fully.

!!! example
    **`com`**`1`
    :    Marks the first task on the current list as complete. Our system recognises it as the complete command

If the commands are ambiguous, our system will ask you for clarification of which command you wish to execute.

For example, typing just `e` could refer to `edit` or `exit` so a message as shown below will be displayed to you.

<img src="images/app_ambiguous.png" width="700" alt="Feedback when an ambiguous command is entered" />

<figcaption>The app will prompt you if it cannot figure out the command you are entering</figcaption>

### Command Preview™

We also understand that it takes time for new users to remember all the commands. As such, we have a CommandPreview™ which tells you the parameters of the command you have to enter. For example, if you type `ad` the system will process your keystrokes and display to you what commands it thinks you are going to execute and displays them as shown below:

<img src="images/app_command_preview.png" width="700" alt="CommandPreview™" />

<figcaption>No need for remembering commands when Uncle Jim does the remembering for you.</figcaption>
