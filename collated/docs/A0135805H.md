<p>Referring to the diagram above, you may notice that the <abbr title="User interface">UI</abbr> mainly consists of a <code>MainWindow</code>. This is where most of the interactions between the user and the application happen here. The <code>MainWindow</code> contains several major view elements that are discussed in greater detail below:</p>

<li><code>CommandErrorView</code> - a detailed breakdown of any erroneous commands presented with a table</li>
</ul>
<p>These view classes are represented by the <code>CommandXView</code> class in the UML diagram above. </p>
<p>The <code>CommandController</code> class is introduced to link the three classes together, so they can work and communicate with each other. The <code>CommandController</code>:</p>
<ol>

### UI component

<img alt="UI Component UML diagram" src="diagrams/Ui Component.png" />

<figcaption>The relation between the UI subcomponents</figcaption>

The UI component handles the interaction between the user and application. If you refer to the architecture diagram in the above sections, you will realise that the UI is responsible for passing the textual command input from the user to the `Logic` for execution, and displaying the outcome of the execution to the user via the GUI.

Some of the GUI view classes are shown in the UI components diagram above. You may also find the implementation for the GUI in the package `seedu.todo.ui`.

<img src="diagrams/Ui Image.png" />

<figcaption>Visual identification of view elements in the UI</figcaption>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/todo/ui/Ui.java)

Referring to the diagram above, you may notice that the UI mainly consists of a `MainWindow`. This is where most of the interactions between the user and the application happen here. The `MainWindow` contains several major view elements that are discussed in greater detail below:

#### Command Line Interface

The UI aims to imitate the Command Line Interface (CLI) closely by accepting textual commands from users, and displaying textual feedback back to the users. The CLI consists of:

- `CommandInputView` - a text box for users to key in their commands
- `CommandPreviewView` - a list of suggested commands from user inputs
- `CommandFeedbackView` - a single line text that provides a response to their commands
- `CommandErrorView` - a detailed breakdown of any erroneous commands presented with a table

These view classes are represented by the `CommandXView` class in the UML diagram above. 

The `CommandController` class is introduced to link the three classes together, so they can work and communicate with each other. The `CommandController`:

1. Obtains a user-supplied command string from the `CommandInputView`
2. Submits the command string to `Logic` for execution
3. Receives a `CommandResult` from `Logic` after the execution
4. Displays the execution outcome via the `CommandResult` to the `CommandFeedbackView` and `CommandErrorView`

In the meantime, the `CommandPreviewView` listens to any user input through an event bus `ShowPreviewEvent` located in the `UiManager` and displays the suggested commands as required.

#### To-do List Display

A to-do list provides a richer representation of the tasks than the CLI to the users. The To-do List Display consists of: 

- `TodoListView` - a [`ListView`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/ListView.html) that displays a list of `TaskCard`
- `TaskCardView` - an item in the `TodoListView` that displays details of a specific task
- `EmptyListView` - a view overlapping the `TodoListView` which indicates that no task is displayed

Specifically, the `TodoListView` attaches an `ObservableList` of `ImmutableTask` from the `Model` and listens to any changes that are made to the `ObservableList`. If there are any modifications made, the `TaskCard` and `TodoListView` are updated automatically.

Also, the `EmptyListView` listens to the `ObservableList` of `ImmutableTask` if the list is empty. If the list is empty, the `EmptyListView` listens to the `ObservableProperty` of `TaskViewFilter` for the appropriate message to be displayed. You may try switching the views to see the messages yourself.

#### Additional Information

The remaining view classes that are not mentioned are as follows:

- `FilterBarView` - shows a list of available views users can switch to, and indicates the view that the user is currently at
- `GlobalTagView` - shows a global list of tags
- `HelpView` - shows a list of commands that users can use
- `SearchStatusView` - shows the information regarding a search that user has performed

All these view classes, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. You may load these view classes using the utility class `UiPartLoader`.

The UI component uses [JavaFX](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/get-started-tutorial/jfx-overview.htm#JFXST784) UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`CommandInputView`](../src/main/java/seedu/todo/ui/view/CommandInputView.java) is specified in [`CommandInputView.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/CommandInputView.fxml)

Other than through `CommandResult` and `ObservableList`, you may also invoke changes to the GUI outside the scope of UI components by raising an event. `UiManager` will then call specific view elements to update the GUI accordingly. For example, you may show the `HelpView` by raising a `ShowHelpPanel` via the `EventsCentre`.

### GUI Testing

As briefly described above, our GUI tests are _System Tests_. We crafted our GUI tests such that we are able to test every component of the application and the interactions between each component. This is done through the simulation of the user actions on the GUI itself. You may run these GUI tests in the package `guitests` to see the simulation in real life.

#### Structure

If you look inside the `guitests` package, you may realise that we have grouped our test script files into two major locations:

- `guitests` - the actual test script that contains sequences of user actions
- `guitests.guihandles` - view handles that provide direct access to the contents of the displayed view elements

#### Creating GUI Handles

When you create a new view for your GUI, you may want to create a handle for your newly created view. Simply extend your view handle from `GuiHandle` class, and you may start working on your view handle. 

The `GuiHandle` class allows you to search for your view elements by their `id`, and you may retrieve the contents of the view element just like how you do so for any JavaFX view nodes. 

You may view sample codes from handles such as `TaskCardViewHandle` and `CommandErrorViewHandle` in the `guitests.guihandles` package.

#### Creating GUI Tests

When you want to write an automated test script for simulating user actions, you may do so with a JUnit test files. You may refer to examples such as `AddCommandTest` and `DeleteCommandTest` located in the `guitests` package. 

All our GUI JUnit tests are inherited from `TodoListGuiTest`. The `TodoListGuiTest` class provides useful methods based on the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library that makes automation easier. You may refer to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) documentation for more details.

### Managing tags: **`tag`** 
  
Format:   
**`tag`**  
**`tag`**` INDEX TAG1, TAG2, ...`  
**`tag`**` [INDEX] /r OLD NEW`  
**`tag`**` [INDEX] /d TAG`  

You can use tags to organize your tasks easily. Each task may have up to 5 tags. Tags are alpha-numeric and case-insensitive, and you can use hyphens "-" and underscores "\_" in your tags too. You can use the `tag` command to add, edit or delete tags from one or all of the tasks. Here are some of the examples of what you can do with the `tag` command:

#### Viewing all tags used so far

Sometimes you might not want to reuse tags you have used for other tasks previously. To check what tags are already used, simply type `tag` with no flags, and Uncle Jim will show you all tags that are used in the app. 

<img src="images/app_tag.png" width="700" alt="Global Tag List" />

<figcaption>All your tags in one place</figcaption>


#### Adding tags to a task 

If you wish to add tags to a task, simply type `tag` with the `INDEX` and the tag names you wish to add to a task. This does not overwrite any existing tags on a task:

!!! example
    **`tag`**` 1 cs2103T`
    :    Adds the `cs2103T` tag to the first task on the list


#### Editing tags  

You can rename tags for either a single task, or all tasks using `/r`:

!!! example
    **`tag`**` /r Business Pleasure` 
    :    Renames the `Business` tag to `Pleasure` 
    
    **`tag`**` 1 /r Business Pleasure` 
    :    Renames the `Business` tag to `Pleasure` only in task 1. 

!!! note 
    Note that without the *INDEX* parameter, doing this will affect all tasks tagged with the specified tag, such as *Business* in the example above.

#### Deleting tags 

You can also remove a tag from either a single task, or all tasks at once with `/d`: 

!!! example
    **`tag`**` 1 /d important` 
    :    Removes the `important` tag from the first task  
    
    **`tag`**` /d important` 
    :    Removes the `important` tag from **all** tasks. Remember you can always `undo` if you make a mistake. 

!!! note "Keep it simple!"
    Tags are only really necessary if you have a *lot* of tasks. Uncle Jim works just as well even if you don't use tags. For maximum productivity, keep your tags short and simple, and keep them broad so that you can apply them to many tasks. In this manner, we have imposed a maximum of **five** tags per task.
    
### Showing details of a task: **`show`**

  
Format: **`show`**` INDEX`

Descriptions of tasks and events are hidden by default. In order to display them, you can use this command to toggle between the expanded version of a task and its compact form, as shown below:

<img src="images/app_collapse.png" width="700" alt="Expanding a task for more details" />

<figcaption>Get details of any task you need easily</figcaption>



### Switching views: **`view`**
  
Format: **`view`**` VIEW`

You can drill down into your To-do List and see specific tasks, such as your incomplete tasks or today's schedule, using the `view` command:

!!! example
    **`view`**` completed`
    :    Show completed tasks only 


<img src="images/app_screenshot_completed.png" width="700" alt="View of completed tasks" />

<figcaption>Find important and soon overdue tasks</figcaption>

You can also use the underlined character in the view's name as the shortcut when switching views. 

!!! example
    **`view`**`i`
    :    Show incomplete tasks only, since `i` is the underlined character as shown in the image above. 


### Finding tasks: **`find`**

Format: **`find`**` KEYWORD [MORE KEYWORDS] [/t TAGS]`

You can search for tasks using the `find` command. The search is case insensitive and the order of the keywords does not matter. Add the `/t` flag allows you to specifically search for those tags. 

!!! note 
    Keywords are separated by spaces, not comma

!!! example  

    **`find`**`Github`  
    :    Returns tasks with ** Fix Github Issue #119 **
    
    **`find`**` /t code`  
    :    Returns any task tagged with **code** in the tags
    
    **`find`**` git development code`  
    :    Returns any task with either **git**, **development**, or **code** in the title, such as 
         **Fix the app bug in Github #119**, **Watch Tutorial on iOS development**, **Improve code quality with SLAP** and so on and so forth.
    
<img src="images/app_find.png" width="700" alt="Find results view" />

<figcaption>How the above search result using `find` would look like.</figcaption>
    

### Exiting the app: **`exit`**
  
Format: **`exit`**  

If you wish to exit the program, simply type `exit`.
