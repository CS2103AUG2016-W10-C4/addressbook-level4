#### Headless GUI Testing 

Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.
 
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
